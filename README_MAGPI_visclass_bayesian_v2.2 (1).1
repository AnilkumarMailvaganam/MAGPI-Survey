Purpose: This file describes the details of the posterior probabilities from visual
Classifications (see Foster et al. submitted in Nov. 2024). Pls contact the author for additional 
detail or if you notice anything awry.
Dependencies: Individual classifications collected via the MAGPI classification 
shiny app deployed
https://unsw.shinyapps.io/KinematicsClassApp/
Synthetic images from MPDAF, gas kinematic (MAGPIXXXX_v2.2.1_GIST_Full_Maps.tar.gz) 
and stellar kinematic (kinematic_maps_spaxels_2MOM_v2.2.1.tar.xz) maps are based 
on v2.2.1 reduction of the MAGPI MUSE cubes.
Other info: Contributing MAGPItes to this dataset are Caroline Foster, Alina Boecker, 
Anshu Gupta, Caro Derkenne, Eda Gjergo, Eric Muller, Anna Ferre-Mateu, Giulia Santucci, 
Hey-Jin Park, Qianhui Chen, Ryan Bagge, Sabine Bellstedt, Sabine Thater, Sam Vaughan 
and Stefania Barsanti.

***Relevant concepts:***

The code for the online app that was used to collect the visual classifications 
can be found on github: https://github.com/MagpiSurvey/MAGPIClassApp_public

And the app is deployed: https://unsw.shinyapps.io/KinematicsClassApp/ 

Classifications followed the scheme employed by SAMI (see Cortese et al. (2016, 
MNRAS, 463, 170) for morphologies and van de Sande et al. (2021, MNRAS, 505, 3078) 
for kinematics).

***Data product description:***

The file contains the outcome of the Bayesian modeling of the visual classifications
provided by MAGPItes. More information on the Bayesian model is available in Foster et al.
(Submitted in Nov. 2024).

For our purposes, we only included galaxies from the Master catalogue that satisfy 
the following criteria:
1- R50_it > 0.75 x fwhm_i (i.e. source is extended according to ProFound)
2- re > 0.75 x fwhm_r (i.e. source is extended according to GalFit)
3- mag_it < 26 (source is brighter than ~ the completeness limit in i-band, this 
weeds out a lot of faint blobs, though not all, sorry...)

The above selection yields 637 galaxies to visually classify (as at February 2023).

Each MAGPIte got their own special randomly ordered list of the galaxies. This 
ensured that every galaxy was classified by a similar number of MAGPItes.

Column descriptions:
-------------------
MAGPIID
Unique 10-digit MAGPI IDs assigned as a concatenation of the 4 digits FieldID and 
the 3+3 digits (Xmax,Ymax) position of the brightest pixel in the white-light image. 
First 2 digits of the FieldID encode the GAMA field number (12=G12, 15=G15, 23=G23), 
and 3rd and 4th digits encode MAGPI field ID. These IDs may change slightly between 
releases as the brightest pixel may vary depending on the reduction.

***Morph related columns***
Morphology based on synthetic g, r and i image from the MUSE 
datacube cutout to the ProFound segment for that object. 1Re ellipses from 
galfit and the FWHM were shown on the image.
Values were assigned by selecting between
1- Elliptical (E) = smooth, featureless;
2- lenticular (S0) = obvious disk, no evidence for spiral arms, substantial bulge;
3- Early Spiral (eSp) = evidence for spiral arms and a bulge;
4- Late Spiral (lSp) = prominent spiral arms and minimal/no bulge;
5- Irregular (Irr) = no distrinct regular shape;
6- Merger = visual evidence of ongoing merger

Morph_cprob1,2,3,4,5,6 -> Posterior probability of Morph=1,2,3,4,5,6
Morph_post_mode -> Mode of the posterior Morph distribution
Morph_pmode_prob -> Posterior probability of the Morph posterior mode

***StellOR related columns***
Obvious rotation for the stellar kinematics. Value should 
be between [1,2], with 1 = Obvious rotation, 2 = No obvious rotation.
Classifiers were asked to consider whether the respective (gas/star kinematic) 
maps exhibit obvious rotation (OR: clear rotation, possibly accompanied by 
peaked or flat sigma) or no obvious rotation (NOR).

StellOR_cprob1,2 -> Posterior probability of StellOR =1,2
StellOR_post_mode -> Mode of the posterior StellOR distribution
StellOR_pmode_prob -> Posterior probability of the StellOR posterior mode

***StellFeat related columns***    
Visible stellar kinematic features. Value should be between 
[1,2], with 1 = Without feature, 2 = With feature(s).
Classifiers were asked whether or not you can see unusual features in the 
kinematic maps such as 2 velocity dispersion peaks, changes in the kinematic 
position angle such as kinematically decouple cores (KDC) or kinematic twists 
(KT).

StellFeat_cprob1,2 -> Posterior probability of StellFeat =1,2

************FLAGS************

EdgeCase_f
Fraction of classifiers who selected the EdgeCase flag between [0,1] where 
0|1 represents none of|all classifiers having flagged this target as an edge case. 
Edge cases are targets that have been cropped due to being located at the edge of 
the MAGPI field.

BarFlag_f    
Fraction of classifiers who selected the BarFlag flag between [0,1], where 0|1 represents none of|all 
classifiers having flagged this target as a barred galaxy.

VisFeatFlag_f
Fraction of classifiers who selected the the VisFeatFlag. 0 corresponds to no other features visible on 
the image, while 1 corresponds to "there are other features in the image".

StellKinFlag_f 
Fraction of classifiers who selected the quality control value flag for the stellar 
kinematic maps. 
0= there are no issues with the stellar kinematic maps and 
1= there are issues with the stellar kinematic maps.
Classifiers were asked if there are issues with the kinematic data that may 
limit their usability for science by ticking the appropriate box.

GasKinFlag_f
Fraction of classifiers who selected the quality control value flag for the ionised 
gas kinematic maps. 
0= there are no issues with the ionised gas kinematic maps and 
1= there are issues with the ionised gas kinematic maps.
Classifiers were asked if there are issues with the kinematic data that may limit 
their usability for science by ticking the appropriate box.

************OTHER************
NClass
Number of unique/idependent visual classifications performed on this target.

Comments
Compilation of provided comments separated by '/'.



***Usage notes:***

Objects with r-band (mag_rt) < 20 mag have the most robust visual classifications. We 
recommend using pmode_prob values >0.98..
