Purpose: This file describes the creation of the broadband photometry catalogue MAGPI_Photometry_v2.2.0.csv
Dependencies: This product is based on the v2.2.0 (...cloud.../MAGPI/reducedcubes/MAGPI_v2.2/MAGPIXXXX.fits) of the reduced cubes and associated manually edited dilated and undilated segmentation maps (...cloud.../MAGPI/valueadded/analysed_v2.2.0/MAGPIXXXX/segmap/MAGPI1201_manual_segmap.fits 
Other info:
This is based on imaging collated for GAMA DR4

Relevant concepts:
-----------------
This derivation of global photometry for MAGPI is based on the GAMA multi-wavelength images that have been pixel-matched to MAGPI, using the MAGPI-computed ProFound segmentation maps. 

Data product description:
-------------------------
proFoundMultiband is used to compute the global photometry using the following command:
multibandOutput=profoundMultiBand(
		segim = magpi_segmap$imDat,
		inputlist=images,
		itersdet = 0,
		iterstot = 2,
		totappend = 't',
		sizestot = 5,
		colappend = 'c',
		detectbands = c('r', 'Z'),
		multibands = bands_total,
		keepsegims = TRUE,
		magzero = c(0,0,0,0,30,30,30,30,30),
		dotot = TRUE,
		docol = TRUE,
		dogrp = TRUE,
		verbose = TRUE,
		box = c(100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100),
		boxiters = 4,
		boxadd = c(50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50),
		grid = c(50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50),
		roughpedestal = TRUE,
		redosegim = FALSE,
		deblend = FALSE,
		groupstats = TRUE,
		mask = 0,
		SBdilate = 1.0,
		SBN100 = 100,
		appdiam = 1.4,
		fluxtype = 'Jansky'
	)

The Planck foreground dust maps have been used to compute the attenuation for each source, and both dust corrected and uncorrected values are provided in the catalogue. 


Usage notes:
-----------
Dust-corrected values should almost always be used as the default photometry per source. 

Location of files:
------------------
The photometry catalogue is located at MAGPI/valueadded/ProFound_MultiwavelengthPhotom_v2.2.0/MAGPI_Photometry_v2.2.0.csv
Pixel-matched images for KiDS are located at MAGPI/Imaging/v2.0/KiDS/ 
Pixel-matched images for Viking are located at MAGPI/Imaging/v2.0/VIKING/
