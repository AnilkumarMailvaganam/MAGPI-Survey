Purpose: This file describes basic details of how the MAGPI_VisClassStats.csv file 
is created and formatted. Pls contact the author for additional detail or if you 
notice anything awry.
Dependencies: Individual classifications collected via the MAGPI classification 
shiny app deployed
at https://shiny.datacentral.org.au/magpiclassapp/
Synthetic images from MPDAF, gas kinematic (MAGPIXXXX_v2.2.1_GIST_Full_Maps.tar.gz) 
and stellar kinematic (kinematic_maps_spaxels_2MOM_v2.2.1.tar.xz) maps are based 
on v2.2.1 reduction of the MAGPI MUSE cubes.
Other info: Contributing MAGPItes to this dataset are Caroline Foster, Alina Boecker, 
Anshu Gupta, Caro Derkenne, Eda Gjergo, Eric Muller, Anna Ferre-Mateu, Giulia Santucci, 
Hey-Jin Park, Qianhui Chen, Ryan Bagge, Sabine Bellstedt, Sabine Thater, Sam Vaughan 
and Stefania Barsanti.

***Relevant concepts:***

The code for the online app that was used to collect the visual classifications 
can be found on github: https://github.com/MagpiSurvey/MAGPIClassApp

And the app is deployed: https://shiny.datacentral.org.au/magpiclassapp/ 

Classifications followed the scheme employed by SAMI (see Cortese et al. (2016, 
MNRAS, 463, 170) for morphologies and van de Sande et al. (2021, MNRAS, 505, 3078) 
for kinematics).

***Data product description:***

The file is a compilation of all classifications provided by MAGPItes.

For our purposes, we only included galaxies from the Master catalogue that satisfy 
the following criteria:
1- R50_it > 0.75 x fwhm_i (i.e. source is extended according to ProFound)
2- re > 0.75 x fwhm_r (i.e. source is extended according to GalFit)
3- mag_it < 26 (source is brighter than ~ the completeness limit in i-band, this 
weeds out a lot of faint blobs, though not all, sorry...)

The above selection yields 637 galaxies to visually classify (as at February 2023).

Each MAGPIte got their own special randomly ordered list of the galaxies. This 
ensured that every galaxy was classified by a similar number of MAGPItes.

-------------------
Column descriptions:
-------------------
MAGPIID
Unique 10-digit MAGPI IDs assigned as a concatenation of the 4 digits FieldID and 
the 3+3 digits (Xmax,Ymax) position of the brightest pixel in the white-light image. 
First 2 digits of the FieldID encode the GAMA field number (12=G12, 15=G15, 23=G23), 
and 3rd and 4th digits encode MAGPI field ID. These IDs may change slightly between 
releases as the brightest pixel may vary depending on the reduction.

muEdgeCase
Mean value of the EdgeCase flag between [0,1] where 0|1 represents none of|all 
classifiers having flagged this target as an edge case. Edge cases are targets 
that have been cropped due to being located at the edge of the MAGPI field.

MoEdgeCase    
Mode value of the EdgeCase flag (see muEdgeCase).

sdEdgeCase     
Standard deviation of EdgeCase flag (see muEdgeCase).

muMorph
Mean assigned morphology based on synthetic g, r and i image from the MUSE 
datacube cutout to the ProFound segment for that object. 1Re ellipses from 
galfit and the FWHM were shown on the image.
Values were assigned by selecting between
1- Elliptical (E) = smooth, featureless;
2- lenticular (S0) = obvious disk, no evidence for spiral arms, substantial bulge;
3- Early Spiral (eSp) = evidence for spiral arms and a bulge;
4- Late Spiral (lSp) = prominent spiral arms and minimal/no bulge;
5- Irregular (Irr) = no distrinct regular shape;
6- Merger = visual evidence of ongoing merger

MoMorph 
Mode assigned morphology (see muMorph). This is the preferred morphology.

sdMorph    
Standard deviation on the assigned morphology (see muMorph).

fMorph
The fraction of classifiers that have explicitly selected a specific morphology 
(i.e. excluding 0s and 7s). We recommend using MoMorph for objects with fMorph>0.4.

fMorphIDK
The fraction of MAGPItes who answered "I don't know" to the morphology question 
for a given target.

muBarFlag      
Mean value of the BarFlag flag between [0,1], where 0|1 represents none of|all 
classifiers having flagged this target as a barred galaxy.

Mode value of the BarFlag flag (see muBarFlag).

sdBarFlag      
Standard Deviation of the BarFlag flag (see muBarFlag).

muVisFeatFlag 
Mean value of the VisFeatFlag. 0 corresponds to no other features visible on 
the image, while 1 corresponds to "there are other features in the image".

MoVisFeatFlag
Mode value for the VisFeatFlag (see muVisFeatFlag).

sdVisFeatFlag  
Standard Deviation of the VisFeatFlag (see muVisFeatFlag).

muStellOR  
Mean assigned value of obvious rotation for the stellar kinematics. Value should 
be between [1,2], with 1 = Obvious rotation, 2 = No obvious rotation.
Classifiers were asked to consider whether the respective (gas/star kinematic) 
maps exhibit obvious rotation (OR: clear rotation, possibly accompanied by 
peaked or flat sigma) or no obvious rotation (NOR).

MoStellOR   
Mode assigned value of obvious rotation for the stellar kinematics (see muStellOR).
This is the recommended StellOR.

obvious rotation in the stellar kinematic maps or not.

[1,2], with 1 = Without feature, 2 = With feature(s).
Classifiers were asked whether or not you can see unusual features in the 
kinematic maps such as 2 velocity dispersion peaks, changes in the kinematic 
position angle such as kinematically decouple cores (KDC) or kinematic twists 
(KT).

limit their usability for science by ticking the appropriate box.

Comments
Compilation of provided comments separated by '/'.

StellHwC
Caro Foster's subjective and individual opinion of whether the stellar kinematic 
maps should be "handled with care". Either there are large gaps in the map, too 
few spaxels, something weird, cropped map due to being at the edge of the field 
of view, etc. This is subjective and obviously will depend on the science case, 
so please handle using those kinematic maps "with care". If you spot other maps 
that you feel should be handled with care that are not listed, please contact 
Caro F.

GasHwC
Same as StellHwC, but for ionised gas kinematic maps.

mag_rt
ProFound r-band magnitude copied from the master catalogue.

***Usage notes:***

Objects with r-band (mag_rt) < 20 mag have the most robust visual classifications. We 
recommend a minumum of 0.4 in fMorph, fStellOR, fStellFeat, fGasOR and 
fGasFeat as a threshold for meaningful morphology and dynamical classifications.
We further recommend that the Mode (Mo) be used over the mean (mu). Paper is
currently in prep and more detail can be found in the draft at:
